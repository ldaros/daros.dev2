After a long time using React for front-end development, I wanted to try something more simple and fast. ReactJS is a decent framework, but recently I've been prefering more lightweight solutions with less dependencies and better performance.

The previous website used a stack of React, Typescript, SASS, GraphQL, etc...
Overkill for a website and made development a bit more complicated than it should be.

The new website uses Hugo, a static site generator written in Go. It's fast, simple and easy to use. I'm also using the Paper theme.

The whole setup took me less than 30 minutes, and performance appears to be better than anything I'm able to achieve with React.

Sometimes less is more.

Will try to post more in the future.
